# Weather Forecast Vue App

A modern and responsive weather forecast application built with Vue.js 3 and TypeScript. The app provides real-time weather data and focuses on a seamless user experience by offering multiple ways to get a forecast.

## ‚ú® Features

This project highlights a flexible and user-centric approach to fetching data:

- **Multiple Ways to Get a Forecast:**
  - **Search by City:** Manually search for any city in the world. This is a temporary search and does not overwrite your saved preferences.
  - **Geolocation:** Use your current location to get an instant forecast. If you grant permission, your location will be saved as the new default for future visits.

- **Smart Persistence:**
  - The application remembers your last chosen city (either from geolocation or the default "Kyiv") in `localStorage`.
  - If you later revoke location permissions, the app gracefully falls back to using the last saved city without breaking.
